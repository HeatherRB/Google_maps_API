This is a toy project in Google Maps Javascript API. 

It displays a map which is a kind of travel diary - a list of journeys,
each represented by arcs, and a marker for each destination.
The destination marker displays a picture of the destination, 
as well as the distance as the crow flies from the source.

The main components are a html page, a css style file and a js script.
It is not possible to load the project without a Google Maps API key,
and the relevant destination images (not included).
The result can be viewed at http://www.reeve-black.com in the coding section.
